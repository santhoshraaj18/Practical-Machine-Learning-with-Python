## üîç **Introduction**
Machine Learning is a transformative technology that powers modern applications ranging from spam detection to medical diagnosis. This repository serves as a practical guide to various ML algorithms and implementation strategies using Python.

## üöÄ **Algorithms Implemented**
### **1. Find-S Algorithm**
   - A concept learning algorithm for identifying a maximally specific hypothesis.
   - Used in supervised learning to find patterns in labeled datasets.

### **2. Candidate Elimination Algorithm**
   - A method to refine hypotheses using version space theory.
   - Iteratively narrows down possible functions based on positive and negative examples.

### **3. Simple Linear Regression**
   - Predicts numerical values based on a single feature.
   - Uses the least squares method to find the best-fit line.

### **4. Decision Tree (ID3 Algorithm)**
   - Constructs a decision tree using entropy and information gain.
   - Effectively classifies data based on hierarchical splitting.

### **5. Naive Bayes Classifier**
   - Probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem.
   - Assumes conditional independence between features for simplicity.

### **6. K-Means Clustering**
   - Groups similar data points into clusters based on Euclidean distance.
   - Iteratively updates centroids to optimize partitions.

### **7. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with EM Algorithm**
   - A probabilistic model based on multiple Gaussian distributions.
   - Utilizes the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for clustering.

### **8. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - A non-parametric classification technique relying on proximity-based decision-making.
   - Suitable for complex decision boundaries.

### **9. Locally Weighted Regression**
   - Enhances standard regression by applying higher weights to closer data points.
   - Captures local variations in data patterns.

### **10. Bayesian Network for Heart Disease Prediction**
   - Uses probabilistic graphical models for diagnosis based on multiple risk factors.
   - Estimates the likelihood of disease occurrence using learned conditional probabilities.

## üîß **Data Preprocessing**
Data preprocessing is critical for achieving optimal machine learning performance. This repository includes:
- **Handling missing values** (imputation techniques).
- **Normalization & Scaling** (MinMax, StandardScaler).
- **Feature Engineering** (dimensionality reduction & selection).
- **Data visualization** (histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps).

## üî¨ **Methods Used**
Each algorithm is implemented using best practices in Python, with structured workflows:
- **Data Loading:** Reading CSV datasets for training and testing models.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Splitting datasets, accuracy metrics, confusion matrices.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing performance through parameter adjustments.
- **Visualization:** Graphs and insights via `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

## üîç **Introduction**

Machine Learning is revolutionizing how we approach problem-solving, powering everything from personalized recommendations to sophisticated medical diagnoses. This repository serves as your practical companion in navigating the landscape of ML algorithms. Through Python implementations and clear explanations, you'll gain a solid understanding of the core concepts and how to apply them effectively.

## üöÄ **Algorithms Explored**

This repository currently features implementations of the following machine learning algorithms:

### **Supervised Learning**

#### **Concept Learning**
- **1. Find-S Algorithm:** Learn to identify the most specific hypothesis consistent with positive examples.
- **2. Candidate Elimination Algorithm:** Systematically narrow down the set of all consistent hypotheses (the version space).

#### **Regression**
- **3. Simple Linear Regression:** Model the linear relationship between a single independent variable and a dependent variable using the least squares method.
- **9. Locally Weighted Regression:** Adapt the standard linear regression by assigning higher weights to data points closer to the query point, allowing for capturing local non-linearities.

#### **Classification**
- **4. Decision Tree (ID3 Algorithm):** Build a tree-like structure to classify data based on information gain and entropy.
- **5. Naive Bayes Classifier:** A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, assuming feature independence for simplicity and efficiency.
- **8. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Classify data points based on the majority class among their k nearest neighbors in the feature space.

#### **Probabilistic Models**
- **10. Bayesian Network for Heart Disease Prediction:** Utilize a directed acyclic graph to represent probabilistic dependencies between risk factors and the likelihood of heart disease. Learn conditional probabilities from data for prediction.

### **Unsupervised Learning**

#### **Clustering**
- **6. K-Means Clustering:** Partition data into k distinct clusters by iteratively assigning points to the nearest centroid and updating centroid positions.
- **7. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with EM Algorithm:** Model data as a mixture of several Gaussian distributions and use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters of each component, effectively performing soft clustering.

## üîß **Data Handling**

Effective data preprocessing is paramount for building robust machine learning models. This repository demonstrates key techniques, including:

- **Missing Value Handling:** Strategies for dealing with incomplete datasets, such as imputation.
- **Normalization and Scaling:** Techniques like Min-Max scaling and Standardization (using `StandardScaler`) to bring features to a comparable scale.
- **Feature Engineering:** Methods for creating new features from existing ones and techniques for dimensionality reduction and feature selection.
- **Data Visualization:** Utilizing libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to gain insights through histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

## üî¨ **Implementation Highlights**

Each algorithm implementation follows a structured approach, emphasizing best practices in Python for clarity and reproducibility:

- **Modular Code:** Well-organized scripts and notebooks for each algorithm.
- **Clear Data Pipelines:** Demonstrations of loading data (primarily CSV format), splitting into training and testing sets.
- **Model Evaluation:** Implementation of relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, confusion matrices) to assess model performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning (where applicable):** Examples of how to optimize model performance by adjusting key parameters.
- **Informative Visualizations:** Generation of plots to understand data distributions, model behavior, and results.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Getting Started**

To run the code in this repository, you'll need to have Python and a few essential libraries installed on your system. Follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/santhoshraaj18/Practical-Machine-Learning-with-Python.git](https://github.com/santhoshraaj18/Practical-Machine-Learning-with-Python.git)
    cd practical-ml-python
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS and Linux
    # venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```
    Then, install the required libraries using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn pgmpy
    ```

## üöÄ **Exploring the Code**
